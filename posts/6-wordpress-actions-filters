# WordPress Actions & Filters

Actions allow you to add code where the WordPress core, a plug-in or your own code is doing something. 
You need to use the function do_action at this point to allow developers hook into that area using add_action. 

Filters allow you to modify data at a certain point. 
You will need to use apply_filters when writing the code so a developer can use add_filter later on.
