# GitHub Blog

I'm trying an experiment to blog just using Github with markdown files. I may use what is produced in a website in the future but for now it is useful to get my thoughts down, improve my writing and update my Github profile all at the same time.

This will mainly be used for software related topics but if it is interesting enough it could be anything.
